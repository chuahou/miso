*Based on the course taught by Hugo Paquet in Hilary Term 2021 and lecture notes
by Andrew Ker.*

Lambda calculus is a way to reason about functions, and is also a model of
computation. Its most basic form consists of variables, $\lambda$-abstractions
and applications.

* [Syntax](notes/syntax.md)
  ($\lambda$-terms, free/bound variables and capture, contexts)
* [Equational theories](notes/theories.md)
  (equalities, theories, fixed points)
* [Reductions](notes/reductions.md)
  (reductions, $\lambda I$/affine/linear terms)

...

* [Normal forms](notes/nf.md) (NFs, normalizing, diamond/CR/unique-NF,
  $\beta$/$\eta$ CR, commute)
* [Consistency](notes/consistency.md) ($\lambda\beta$/$\lambda\eta$ consistent,
  $\mathcal T_{\text{NF}}$ inconsistent, BÃ¶hm's Theorem)
* [Reduction strategies](notes/redstrats.md)
