*Based on the course taught by Hugo Paquet in Hilary Term 2021 and lecture notes
by Andrew Ker.*

Lambda calculus is a way to reason about functions, and is also a model of
computation. Its most basic form consists of variables, $\lambda$-abstractions
and applications.

* [Syntax](notes/syntax.md)
  ($\lambda$-terms, free/bound variables and capture, contexts)
* [Equational theories](notes/theories.md)
  (equalities, theories, fixed points, consistency, Bohm's thm)
* [Reductions](notes/reductions.md)
  (reductions, $\lambda I$/affine/linear terms)
* [Normal forms](notes/nf.md) (NFs, normalizing, diamond/CR/unique-NF,
  $\beta$/$\eta$/$\beta\eta$ CR)
* [Reduction strategies](notes/redstrats.md) (strategies, red. sequences,
  standard red. sequences)
* [Solvability](notes/solvability.md) (solvability, genericity, theories
  $\mathcal H$, $\mathcal H^*$, sensible, semi-sensible)
* [Computation](notes/computation.md) (bools/$\mathbb N$/lists,
  recursive functions, $\lambda$-definable, undecidability)
* [Combinatory logic](notes/combinatory.md) (CL, translations, CAs,
  $\lambda$-algebras, comb. completeness)
* [Simple types](notes/types.md) ($\text{TA}_\lambda$, typing, typability,
  strongly normalizability)
* [Principal typing](notes/printyp.md) (principal types/deductions, unification,
  Hindley's algo)
